This datapack allows players to copy existing enchanted books they have!

How it works:
First, place an empty book and quill onto a lecturn.
Then, make sure you put the desired enchanted book in your main hand, and nothing in your off hand.
next, right click the lecturn! If you had 5 levels, the lecturn will be emptied and you will have a copy of the enchanted book in your off hand!

Notes:
- there are sounds and particles for successful and failed attempts to "transcribe" an enchantment.
- it always costs 5 levels
- the book and quill must have NEVER had words saved to it. Otherwise, the attempt will fail.
- the new book is an exact copy of the previous one, name included. 
   - If you've combined books to make the original, the copy will still be just as expensive to apply to an item. This is intended.
- Mending has a very high chance of dropping in a jungle temple with this datapack
   - Why add mending like that? TLDR: exploration is a core minecraft experience (thus, it's subjectively a "more minecraft-y" option than villager farming and copius fishing). Also, it encourages players to look for a part of the game (jungle temples) that no one cares about currently.
   - does that make mending too easy to get? nope - villagers are still much, much easier to use for getting mending. Also, honestly, with how rare a jungle temple can be I don't recommend searching for one pre-elytra. Trust me. AFK fishing may have been faster for me in the seed I tested in (at least 8 hrs of searching).
