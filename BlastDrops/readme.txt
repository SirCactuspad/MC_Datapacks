This is a simple datapack that makes certain blocks drop something different when destroyed by an explosion.

cobblestone -> gravel
gravel -> sand

NOTE: this relies on the [tnt|block|mob]ExplosionDropDecay being set to true, meaning some block loss when other blocks are destroyed.
future versions may actually be able to change that, but would eliminate all block loss. noting for future consideration, but not sure if I want that yet.

By default, TNT will NOT cause the new drops to occur, but creepers, beds, anchors, and end crystals will.
