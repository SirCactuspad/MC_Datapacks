This datapack allows players to copy existing writable but not signed books they have!

How it works:
First, place an empty book and quill onto a lectern.
Then, make sure you put the book and quill with writing you want to copy in your main hand, and nothing in your off hand.
next, right click the lectern! The lectern will be emptied and you will have a copy of the book and quill in your off hand!

Notes:
- there are sounds and particles for successful attempts to copy a book.
- the book and quill on the lectern must have NEVER had words saved to it. Otherwise, the attempt will fail.
  - this is a side effect of making sure you don't copy over a book with words in it already.
- the new book is an exact copy of the previous one, name included.
